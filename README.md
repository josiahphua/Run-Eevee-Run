# Run-Eevee-Run

Play the game [here](https://josiahphua.github.io/Run-Eevee-Run/)

So Eevee will run and then have to jump too. 

Animation for background and placement of Eevee, Thunderstone, and Berries successful.

Timing seems ok, keyframes has to be adjusted on a later timing.

Logic: Each stage will have a timer and score. Once reach end point, score will be shown and the next stage button will show. If player decides to go to the next stage, then new stage will begin(background change to show stage change.) ; timing and speed will be adjusted. Score per chocolate will change too.

1. Once Character touches berryP: berryP will disappear and points go up

2. Once Character touches berryT: berryT will disappear and time will increase by 5sec.



 Things/Issues to take note for later solving:

1. Adjust timing of keyframes (should be about done.)

2. ~Adjust background height/width to fit into div.<< Find out how since I'm unable to change the width property.~ (this is done)

3. Write and test out JS to fit for 1 stage. Logic for subsequent stages can be figured out later.

4. Figure out how to add the end stage design to show clearing of stage.

5. Figure out how to stop my overflow from showing.
